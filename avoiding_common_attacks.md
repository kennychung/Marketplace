## What measures did you take to ensure that your contracts are not susceptible to common attacks?
- To improve the security of this contract, the code has been programmed to follow the recommendations provided by Consensys. First, the contract doesnâ€™t make any external calls since it can introduce unexpected risks. Second, to send ether, send() has been used instead of call.value() since it can trigger malicious code. send() is safe because it only has access to gas stipend of 2,300 gas which is not enough to launch an attack
